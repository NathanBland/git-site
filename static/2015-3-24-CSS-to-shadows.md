I've been working on the layout of this site quite a bit, and although I am a fan of material design, I think for the brief post listings the drop shadow was becoming a bit much.

I've toned down the drop-shadow values all over the site to make them more subtle in appearance. I think the overall look is now better because of it. A lot of places in my css file look like this right now:
```css
article:hover {
    /* box-shadow: 0px 2px 6px black; /* Disabled until futher evaluation */
}
```
Which isn't very clean to say the least, but it *is* effective for now.
