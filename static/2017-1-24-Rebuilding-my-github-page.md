My Github `gh-pages` site has been out of date for a considerable amount of time, I thought it was time it saw an update.   I considered sticking with something like `Jekyll`, like my last iteration had been. However, I've been playing with `vue.js` too much to not use it here.

# No CSS libs
One of my primary goals with this, and the previous iteration of the site was to completely role my own style instead of using something heavier.

I also wanted to design the site to be easy to read, and completely with `flex` for arranging items. 

The end result is a site built on top of `vue.js`, & `vue-router` for the primary functions. Along with `marked.js`, & `highlight.js` 
for composing and highlighting markdown posts.
